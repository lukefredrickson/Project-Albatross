Project Albatross is a 3d open world exploration game developed in Unreal Engine as a school project at Lakeside School by three high school seniors in an upper level computer science course.

Development officially started on February 2nd, 2018.
Development was concluded in early June, 2018.

I have forked the original repository to clean up the code and showcase on my portfolio.
